# What is this repository?

I try some solutions to C++ coding problems, I try different approaches. I want to keep track of these attempts for myself, but I'd be even happier if other people used this repo.

# Requirements

Have make. 

Have googletest. You can put it anywhere on your machine, but make sure that you create a softlink at /usr/share/gtest
